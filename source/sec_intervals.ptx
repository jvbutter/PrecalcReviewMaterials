  <title>Intervals on the real line</title>
  <introduction>
    <p>In what follows, we assume that <m>x</m> and <m>y</m> are real numbers.</p>

    <p><idx>set builder notation</idx><term>Set builder notation</term> is a way of describing sets of real numbers that satisfy some condition: <m>\{ x:</m> "some condition" <m>\}</m> describes the set of all real numbers for which the condition is true.</p>

    <p>For example: <m>\{ x : -2 \leq x \leq 5 \}</m> represents the set of all real numbers that are greater than or equal to <m>-2</m> and less than or equal to <m>5</m>.  This set is often described using interval notation; see below.</p>

    <p><idx>interval notation</idx><term>Interval Notation</term>.  Intervals of numbers on the real line are denoted using brackets.  Different types of brackets have different meanings.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><m>\big[</m> and <m>\big]</m> are used to indicate that the endpoints of the interval are included.  These correspond to <m>\leq</m> and <m>\geq</m> when the interval is described using inequalities.  For example, <m>\big[ a, b \big] = \{ x: a\leq x\leq b\}</m> . Therefore <m>\big[ 0, 9 \big] = \{ x : 0 \leq x \leq 9 \}</m>.  This set contains numbers such as 0, 4, <m>\pi</m> , 8.3759838459, <m>\frac{1}{6}</m>, 9, etc.  There are infinitely many members of this set.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><m>\big(</m> and <m>\big)</m> are used to indicate that the endpoints of the interval are <em>not</em> included. These correspond to <m>\lt</m> and <m>></m> when the interval is described using inequalities.  For example, <m>\big( a, b \big) = \{ x: a \lt x \lt b\}</m> . Therefore, <m>\big( 2, 5 \big)</m> = <m>\{ x : 2 &lt; x &lt; 5 \}</m>.  This set contains numbers such as 2.0000000001, 4, <m>\pi</m>, <m>\frac{7}{3}</m> etc.  There are also infinitely many members of this set.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The two types of brackets discussed above can be used together.  For example, <m>\big[ -3, 7 \big)</m> = <m>\{ x : -3 \leq x &lt; 7 \}</m>.  This set also has infinitely members, and in particular contains <m>-3</m> but not 7.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><em>Note:</em> Since infinity is not a real number, we must always use an open bracket for infinity or negative infinity. ex <m>\big ( -\infty , 4 \big ]</m>.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <warning>It is important to remember that not all real numbers are integers.For example, the set <m>\big [ 2, 3 \big ]</m> is <em>not</em> equal to <m>\big ( 1, 4 \big )</m> <mdash/> there are many numbers, such as <m>1.3</m>, that are in the interval <m>(1,4)</m> but are not in the interval <m>[2,3]</m>.</warning>
    
    <p><em>Combining intervals</em>.
      The set <m>\{x : 2 &lt; x &lt; 5 \mbox{ or } 6 &lt; x &lt; 9\}</m> is the set of all real numbers that are in the interval <m>(2,5)</m> <em>or</em> are in the interval <m>(6,9)</m>.  
      We use the <m>\cup</m> symbol to signify the <term>union</term> of two sets.  
      For example, <m>\{x : 2 &lt; x &lt; 5 \mbox{ or } 6 &lt; x &lt; 9\}=(2,5)\cup(6,9)</m>, 
      and</p>
    <m>\{x : x\neq -4 \} = (-\infty,-4)\cup(-4,\infty)</m>.
    
    <p><idx>intersection</idx><idx>union</idx>More generally, if <m>A</m> and <m>B</m> are two sets of real numbers then their <term>union</term>, denoted <m>A \cup B</m>, is the set of all numbers that are in <m>A</m>, <m>B</m>, or both.  Their <term>intersection</term>, denoted <m>A \cap B</m>, is the set of all numbers that are in both <m>A</m> and <m>B</m>.</p>
    
    <p>For example, <m>(-\infty, 2) \cap [-1, 5]</m> is the set of all real numbers <m>x</m> that are less than <m>2</m> <em>and</em> satisfy <m>-1\leq x \leq 5</m>.  That is, <m>(-\infty, 2) \cap [-1,5]=[-1,2)</m>.  Another way to think about this set is as the solution set to the <term>system of inequalities</term> (or <term>compound inequality</term>) <m>x \lt 2,\ \ x \geq -1,\ \ x \leq 5</m>.</p>
