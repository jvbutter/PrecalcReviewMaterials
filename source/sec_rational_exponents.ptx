    <p><idx>rational exponent</idx>
      For a positive real number <m>x</m> and positive integers <m>m</m> and <m>n</m>, 
      we define <m>x^{\frac{m}{n}}</m> to be the positive real number <m>y</m> such that <m>y^n = x^m</m>, 
      if such a number <m>y</m> exists.
      Notice that this coincides with the <xref ref="def_nth_root" text="custom">definition</xref> of reciprocal exponents <m>\frac{1}{n}</m> when <m>m = 1</m>.
      We define <m>0^\frac{m}{n}</m> to be <m>0</m>.
    </p>

    <example>
      <title>Working out Rational Exponents</title>
      <statement>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>By definition, 
              <m>9^\frac{1}{2}</m>
              is the positive real number <m>y</m> such that <m>y^2=9^1</m>.
              Because <m>3^2 = 9^1</m>, we conclude that
              <m>9^\frac{1}{2}=3</m>,
              just as in <xref ref="sec_reciprocal_exponents"/>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Similarly,
              <m>8^\frac{2}{3}</m> 
              is the positive real number <m>y</m> such that <m>y^3=8^2</m>.
              Because <m>4^3 = 64 = 8^2</m>, we conclude that
              <m>8^\frac{2}{3}=4</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
<!--           <li>
            <p>
              <m>(-3)^\frac{5}{2}</m> is undefined since <m>(-3)^5 = -243</m> and a negative number is not the square of any number (because <m>y^2 \geq 0</m> for every real number <m>y</m>).
            </p>
          </li> -->
        </ul>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>It follows from this definition above, and those in <xref ref="sec_reciprocal_exponents"/> that for positive <m>x</m></p>

    <me>x^\frac{m}{n} = \left(x^m\right)^\frac{1}{n}</me>.

    <p>It is more involved to demonstrate carefully, but it is also true that</p>

    <me>x^\frac{m}{n} = \left(x^\frac{1}{n}\right)^m.</me>

    <example xml:id="ex2">
      <title>Rational Exponents Read Both Ways</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Consider the number <m>9^\frac{3}{2}</m>,
        which is the positive real number <m>y</m> such that <m>y^2=9^3</m>, or equivalently 
        <m>y^2=729</m>.
        This is precisely the definition of <m>729^\frac{1}{2}</m>, 
        and so we have shown that <m>9^\frac{3}{2}=\left(9^3\right)^\frac{1}{2}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>If we want to work with  <m>9^\frac{3}{2}</m>, we might find it useful to think of it as
          <m>\left(9^3\right)^\frac{1}{2}=729^\frac{1}{2}=\sqrt{729} = 27</m>.
          On the other hand, we might prefer to think of it as
          <m>\left(9^\frac{1}{2}\right)^3=\left(\sqrt{9}\right)^3 = 3^3=27</m>.
          Which one you prefer probably depends on whether you recognized <m>\sqrt{729}</m>.

            <p>
              <m>5^\frac{3}{2} = \left(5^3\right)^\frac{1}{2} = \sqrt{125}</m>.  Also <m>5^\frac{3}{2} = \left(5^\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \left(\sqrt{5}\right)^3 = \sqrt{125}</m>.  Note that <m>\left(\sqrt{5}\right)^3 = \sqrt{125}</m> because squaring both sides gives 125.

      </statement>
    </example>
    <p>
      Notice that <m>x^\frac{m}{n}=\left(x^\frac{1}{n}\right)^m</m>
      is consistent with the <xref ref="def_powersofpowers" text="custom">powers of powers</xref> rule.
      In fact, all of the familiar rules of exponents apply to expressions involving rational exponents, provided that the base is positive.
      When exponential expressions with the same base are multiplied, the exponents are added, as in:
      <me>2^\frac{2}{3} 2^\frac{4}{5} = 2^{\frac{2}{3} + \frac{4}{5}} = 2^\frac{22}{15}</me>
    </p>
    <p>
      When an exponential expression is raised to a power, the exponents are multiplied:
      <me>\left(3^\frac{3}{4}\right)^\frac{2}{5} = 3^\frac{6}{20}</me>.
      When a rational exponent is not in lowest terms, as in the above example, we can reduce it:
      <me>3^\frac{6}{20}=3^\frac{3}{10}</me>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, negative rational exponents behave as expected as long as the base is positive.
      Following the <xref ref="def_negexponents" text="custom">negative exponents</xref> rule:
      <me>
        \begin{aligned}
          x^{-\frac{m}{n}} &amp;= \left(x^{-1}\right)^\frac{m}{n} \\
          &amp;= \left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^\frac{m}{n} \\
          &amp;= \left(\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)^m\right)^\frac{1}{n} \\
          &amp;= \left(\frac{1}{x^m}\right)^\frac{1}{n}
          &amp;= \frac{1}{x^\frac{m}{n}}
        \end{aligned}
      </me>
      when <m>x^{\frac{m}{n}}</m> is defined and not <m>0</m>.

      <title>The problem with negative bases</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
         Why have we been so careful to exclude negative bases?
         The short answer is that no definition gives us everything we want from them.
         If you are intereseted in the long answer, here it is - but you do not need to go this far and should not let this digression cause you confusion!
        </p>
        <p>
         Consider as an example <m>\left(-3\right)^\frac{6}{2}</m>.
         If we want everything we have said so far to be true, then this number should be the same as
         <me>\left(\left(-3\right)^6\right)^\frac{1}{2} = \left(729\right)^\frac{1}{2}=27</me>.
         On the other hand, however, it should also be the same as 
         <me>\left(\left(-3\right)^\frac{1}{2}\right)^6,</me>
         which is undefined because <m>(-3)^\frac{1}{2}</m> is not a real number.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe we could change our definition to attempt to address this problem?
          Perhaps we should decide that
          <m>x^\frac{m}{n}</m> is defined to be 
          <m>\left(x^\frac{1}{n}\right)^m</m>.
          Sadly, this alternative introduces a new problem:
          <m>\left(\left(-3\right)^\frac{1}{2}\right)^6</m> is undefined, but 
          <m> \left(-3\right)^3=-27</m>; 
          we have lost the ability to reduce exponents to lowest terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          Perhaps we should decide that
          <m>x^\frac{m}{n}</m> is defined to be
          <m>\left(x^m\right)^\frac{1}{n}</m>?
          Unfortunately, we have the same problem:
          <m>\left(\left(-3\right)^6\right)^\frac{1}{2}=\left(729\right)^\frac{1}{2}=27</m>, but 
          <m> \left(-3\right)^3=-27</m>.
        </p>
      </statement>      
    </example>
    <!-- <p>When a rational exponent is not in lowest terms, for example as in the last bullet point of <xref ref="ex2">Example</xref>, it is tempting to reduce it to lowest terms.  Care is needed, however, because that can be a terrible idea.  Using that same example, <m>\left(-3\right)^\frac{6}{2} = 27</m>, but <m>\left(-3\right)^3 = -27</m>.  Hence <m>\left(-3\right)^\frac{6}{2} \neq \left(-3\right)^3</m> even though <m>\frac{6}{2} = 3</m>.  Why?  It is a question of applying the definition properly.  The difficulty is that <m>(-3)^6</m> is positive, so that <m>\left(-3\right)^\frac{6}{2} = \left(\left(-3\right)^6\right)^\frac{1}{2}</m> is positive, but <m>\frac{6}{2} = 3</m> is an odd integer and a negative number raised to an odd power is negative.  When reducing a rational exponent to lowest terms, one should always check whether the expression obtained has the same sign as the original expression.  This issue only arises when the base is negative.</p> -->
    <p>
      We are now equipped to work with any sort of rational exponent as long as the base is not negative.

              Because <m>625^\frac{1}{4}</m> is defined, we can also compute <m>(625^\frac{1}{4})^3 = 5^3 = 125</m>, which is arguably an easier calculation.
