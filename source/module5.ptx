            For trigonometry review material, we are indebted to by Philip S. Crooke, Professor of Mathematics (emeritus) at Vanderbilt University,
            who has allowed us to share extracts from his materials <q>Algebra and Trigonometry Review Material</q>.
            
            Professor Crooke's complete review material (in PDF form) is avaialble <url href="https://math.vanderbilt.edu/crookeps/calculus/AT1.pdf">on his website</url> 
        </p>
        <p>
            We are in the process of converting Professor Crooke's PDF to be compatible with this book; please check back in late August 2023.
            In the meantime, the portion we have extracted for your use is available, also as a PDF, <url href="https://www.uvic.ca/science/math-statistics/assets/docs/msac/trigreviewwithkey.pdf">on the UVic website</url>.
