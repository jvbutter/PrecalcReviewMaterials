    <p><idx>polynomial</idx>A <term>polynomial</term> is a function described by an expression of the form <m>f(x)=a_nx^n + \cdots + a_1x+a_0</m>, where <m>a_0, a_1,\ldots,a_n</m> are real numbers and <m>n\geq0</m> is an integer.</p>

    <p><idx>terms of a polynomial</idx> <idx>coefficient</idx> <idx>constant term</idx> The expressions <m>a_n x^n, a_{n-1}x^{n-1}, \ldots, a_1x, a_0</m> are called the <term>terms</term> of the polynomial <m>f</m>.  For each integer <m>k = 0, 1, \ldots, n</m>, the number <m>a_k</m> is called the <term>coefficient</term> of <m>x^k</m> in the polynomial <m>f</m>.  The number <m>a_0</m> is called the <term>constant term</term> of <m>f</m>.  Notice that <m>a_0 = a_0 x^0</m>, so that <m>a_0</m> is the coefficient of <m>x^0</m>.</p>

    <p><idx>degree</idx> <idx>leading term</idx> <idx>leading coefficient</idx> Let <m>f(x) =a_nx^n + \cdots + a_1x+a_0</m> be a polynomial in which at least one of the coefficients is not zero.  Then, the <term>degree</term> of <m>f</m> is the largest integer <m>k</m> such that the coefficient of <m>x^k</m> is not zero.  (Notice that such an integer <m>k</m> is guaranteed to exist.)  In this case, <m>a_kx^k</m> is the <term>leading term</term> of <m>f</m>, and <m>a_k</m> is the <term>leading coefficient</term> of <m>f</m>.  Since <m>a_0 = a_0 x^0</m>, it is possible for a polynomial to have degree zero.</p>

        <p>Let <m>f(x)=2x^3-10x+9</m>.  Then,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>the terms of <m>f</m> are <m>2x^3</m>, <m>0x^2</m>, <m>-10x</m>, and <m>9</m>;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the coefficients of <m>f</m> are the numbers <m>2, 0, -10</m>, and <m>9</m>;</p>

          <li>
            <p>the degree of <m>f</m> is 3, the leading term of <m>f</m> is <m>2x^3</m>, and the leading coefficient of <m>f</m> is 2;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the constant term of <m>f</m> is 9.</p>

      <title>Understanding another Polynomial</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Let <m>f(x) = 14</m>.  Then,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>the only term of <m>f</m> is <m>14 = 14x^0</m>;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the only coefficient of <m>f</m> is <m>14</m>;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the degree of <m>f</m> is 0, the leading term of <m>f</m> is <m>14 = 14x^0</m>, and the leading coefficient of <m>f</m> is 14;</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>the constant term of <m>f</m> is 14.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p><idx>zero polynomial</idx> The polynomial in which all coefficients are zero, that is <m>f(x) = 0 + 0x + 0x^2 \cdots</m>, is called <term>the zero polynomial</term>.  It is the only polynomial for which the degree is undefined.</p>

    <p>An <em>important fact</em> is that if <m>f(x)</m> is a polynomial, then <m>f(a)=0</m> if and only if <m>(x-a)</m> divides <m>f(x)</m>.  In other words, <m>a</m> is a root of the polynomial <m>f(x)</m> if and only if <m>(x-a)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>.  Hence to check whether <m>x-a</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>, check whether <m>f(a) = 0</m>.  Conversely, if <m>f(a) = 0</m> then <m>(x-a)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m>.</p>

    <example>
      <title>Testing for Roots of a Polynomial</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Let <m>f(x)=2x^3+x^2+1</m>.  Then,</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p><m>x-1</m> is not a factor of <m>f(x)</m> because we can calculate <m>f(1) = 4 \neq 0</m> and so <m>1</m> is not a root of <m>f(x)</m>.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <m>x+1 = x- (-1)</m> is a factor of <m>f(x)</m> because <m>f(-1) = 0</m>.  In fact, <m>f(x) = (x+1)(2x^2 - x + 1)</m>.
              We can check this by multiplication <m>(x+1)(2x^2 - x + 1) = 2x^3 - x^2 + x + 2x^2 - x + 1 = 2x^3+x^2+1</m>.
              (The factors in this expression can be found by long division, as discussed below.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              We can use the quadratric formula to verify that <m>2x^2-x+1</m> has no roots, which means there are no more roots of <m>f(x)</m>.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p>A <em>useful fact</em> is that if a polynomial <m>f(x)</m> has leading coefficient equal to 1, then an integer <m>a</m> can be a root of <m>f(x)</m> only if <m>a</m> or <m>-a</m> is a divisor of the constant term <m>a_0</m>.  It may be that all, some, or none of these are actually roots of <m>f</m>.  Also, <m>f</m> may have roots that are not integers.</p>
    
    <example xml:id="ex8">
      <title>Finding the Roots of a Polynomial</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Let <m>f(x)=x^3-x^2-2x+2</m>.  Since the leading coefficient of <m>f</m> is 1, the only possible integers which could possibly be roots of <m>f</m> are the divisors of 2 and their negatives, that is <m>1, -1, 2</m>, and <m>-2</m>.  Of these possibilities, only <m>1</m> is a root (because <m>f(1) = 0</m> whereas <m>f(-1), f(2)</m> and <m>f(-2)</m> are all non-zero).  In fact, <m>f(x) = (x-1)(x^2 - 2)</m>
        </p>
      </statement>
    </example>

    <p><idx>polynomial long division</idx> Once we know a root of a polynomial, we can factor the polynomial using long division.  
      Polynomials are divided just like numbers.  
      We saw in <xref ref="ex8">Example</xref> that 1 is a root of <m>f(x)=x^3-x^2-2x+2</m>, so we can divide <m>f(x)</m> by <m>x-1</m>
      (see <xref ref="fig-polylongdiv">Figure</xref>).
      Because the remainder is <m>0</m>, this means that <m>x^3-x^2-2x+2=(x-1)(x^2-2)</m>.
      We can factor further, because <m>(x^2-2) = (x-\sqrt{2})(x+\sqrt{2})</m>, so:
      <me>f(x)=(x-1)\left(x-\sqrt{2}\right)\left(x+\sqrt{2}\right)</me>
      Since a product of numbers equals zero if and only if one of them is zero, 
      <m>f(x)=0</m> if and only if <m>x-1=0</m> or <m>x-\sqrt{2}=0</m> or <m>x+\sqrt{2}=0</m>, 
      and so the roots of <m>f(x)</m> are <m>-1</m>, <m>\sqrt{2}</m> and <m>-\sqrt{2}</m>.

    <p>For any number <m>x</m> in its domain, and expression represents a number.  If we remember that <m>x</m> just represents a number in the domain, then expressions involving a variable can be factored (using the commutative, associative and distributive laws).</p>

    <example xml:id="ex9">
      <title>Factoring a Polynomial</title>
      <statement>
        <me>

            &amp;= (x+1)[2x+(x+1)] \\
            &amp;= (x+1)(3x+1)
          \end{aligned}

    <example xml:id="ex10">
      <title>Factoring another Polynomial</title>

    <p>Notice that, in <xref ref="ex9">Examples</xref> and <xref ref="ex10"></xref>, factoring would have been much more difficult if the expression had been multiplied out.  Sometimes factoring requires creatively grouping the terms.</p>
