    <p><idx>function</idx><idx>domain</idx><idx>range</idx> 
      Let <m>D</m> be a set of real numbers.  
      Any way of associating exactly one real number with each element of <m>D</m> is called a <term>function</term>.  
      The set <m>D</m> is called the function's <term>domain</term>.  
      For any <m>x</m> in <m>D</m>, we call <m>f(x)</m> the <term>value of <m>f</m> at <m>x</m></term>.  
      The set <m>\{f(x) : x \mbox{ is in }  D\} = \{y: y = f(x) \mbox{ for some }</m>x<m>\mbox{ in }  D\}</m> 
      is called the function's <term>range</term> <mdash/> that is, the range of <m>f</m> is the set of all numbers that occur as values of <m>f</m>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the function <m>f</m> is described by giving a formula, 
      then for any number in the domain the value of <m>f</m> at that number is obtained by substituting that number for the variable in the formula
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, if the function <m>f</m> is described by <m>f(x) = 5x^2 - x +1</m> 
      and the domain is the set of all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}</m>, 
      then to find <m>f(2)</m> we substitute 2 into the formula for <m>x</m>, as in:
      <me>f(2) = 5(2)^2 - (2) + 1 = 5 \cdot 4 - 2 + 1 = 20 - 2 + 1 = 19</me>.
      Therefore, <m>f(2) = 19</m>.
    </p>
    <p><em>Assumed domains</em>.  
      When the domain <m>D</m> is not explicitly given in the description of the function, 
      we assume it is the largest collection of numbers for which the function makes sense (is defined).
    </p>
    <p><em>Finding the range</em>.  
      When finding the range of a function that's described by an expression, there are usually two steps involved.  
      The first step is to determine a set of possible values the function could take. 
      The second step is to verify that each one of these is actually achieved for at least one <m>x</m> in the domain.
    </p>

    <example>
      <title>Finding Domains and Ranges</title>
      <statement>
        <p>For each function, find the assumed domain <m>D</m>, that is, the largest collection of numbers for which the function is defined. In addition, find the range of the function.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <m>f(x) = x^2 -5</m>
          </li>
          <li>
            <m>f(x) = \sqrt{x-5} + 3</m>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          The expression <m>x^2 - 5</m> is defined for all real numbers, 
          so its assumed domain is the set of all real numbers, <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.  
          Since, for every real number <m>x</m>, the quantity <m>x^2</m> is at least zero, <m>x^2-5</m> is at least <m>0-5 = -5</m>.  
          Therefore the possible numbers that can be in the range are the real numbers which are at least <m>-5</m>. 
          Take any <m>y \geq -5</m>.  
          Then <m>y = x^2 - 5</m> if and only if <m>y+5 = x^2</m>, 
          and <m>y + 5 \geq 0</m> so <m>x = \pm \sqrt{y + 5}</m>.  
          Hence there is always at least one number <m>x</m> the domain such that <m>f(x) = y</m>, 
          so the range is <m>\{ y : y \geq -5 \}</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
      <solution>
        <p>The expression <m>\sqrt{x-5} + 3</m> involves a square root, and the square root function only makes sense for non-negative numbers (it is only defined for non-negative numbers).  That means we need to have <m>x -5 \geq 0</m>, or equivalently <m>x \geq 5</m>.  There are no other restrictions on the values of <m>x</m> that can be used.  Therefore, the domain is <m>\{ x : x \geq 5\}</m>.  Since for every <m>x \geq 5</m> the quantity <m>\sqrt{x-5} \geq 0</m>, we know that <m>\sqrt{x-5} + 3 \geq 0+3 = 3</m>.  Therefore the possible numbers that can be in the range are the real numbers which are at least <m>3</m>.  Take any <m>y \geq 3</m>.  Then <m>y = \sqrt{x-5} + 3</m> if and only if <m>y - 3 = \sqrt{x-5}</m>, which implies <m>(y-3)^2 = x-5</m>.  Thus, if <m>f(x) = y</m> then <m>x = (y-3)^2 + 5</m>.  Since <m>y \geq 3</m>, the quantity <m>(y-3)^2 + 5</m> is in the domain.  Furthermore, if <m>x = (y-3)^2 + 5</m>, then</p>
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}
            f(x) &amp;= f((y-3)^2 + 5) \\
            &amp;= \sqrt{(y-3)^2 + 5 -5} + 3 \\
            &amp;= \sqrt{(y-3)^2} + 3 \\
            &amp;= |y-3| + 3 \\
            &amp;= (y-3) + 3\\
            &amp;= y
          \end{aligned}
        </me>.
        <p>We've used <m>|y-3| = y-3</m> because <m>y - 3 \geq 0</m>.  Therefore,  the range is <m>\{ y : y \geq 3 \}</m>.</p>
      </solution>
    </example>

    <p>A function can be defined by an equation.  For example, for the equation <m>y = 10x - 7</m>, once we choose a value for <m>x</m>, then <m>y</m> is uniquely determined: as in the definition of a function, the equation <m>y = 10x - 7</m> associates exactly one number <m>y</m> with each number <m>x</m>.</p>

    <example>
      <title>Is this a function?</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Does the equation <m>x=y^2+5</m> define <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>?</p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
          No.  For example, when <m>x=6</m>, the statements <m>6 = (-1)^2 + 5</m> and <m>6 = 1^2 + 5</m> are both true.  Thus this equation associates two values of <m>y</m>, namely <m>\pm 1</m>, with <m>x = 6</m>, and so it does not define <m>y</m> as a function of <m>x</m>.
        </p>
      </solution>
    </example>
        <p>
          This is a good time to introduce the <idx><term>absolute value function</term></idx>, written <m>|x|</m>.
          When <m>x</m> is positive or zero, the absolute value is just <m>x</m> itself: <m>|x|=x</m>.
          When <m>x</m> is negative, however, <m>|x|=-x</m>.
          This function is defined for all real numbers, so its assumed domain is <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
          Notice that if <m>x</m> is negative then <m>-x</m> is positive, and so the functions range is 
          <m>\{y : y\geq 0\}</m>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The absolute value function is also an example of a <idx><term>piecewise-defined function</term></idx>, 
          which is a function that can be expressed by formulas, but uses different formulas for different parts of its domain.
          The notation we use for a piecewise-defined-function looks like this:
          <me>|x|=\begin{cases}-x \amp, x \lt 0 \\
                  x \amp, x \ge 0 \end{cases}.
          </me>
        </p>
    <example>
      <title>Intervals and absolute values</title>
      <p>
        Consider the set <m>\{x : |x|\lt 3\}</m>.
        This certainly includes all of the numbers <m>0\le x \lt 3</m>, 
        but recall that for negative values of <m>x</m> the absolute value <m>|x|</m> is positive.
        So in fact <m>\{x : |x| \lt 3\} = (-3,3)</m>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a more challenging example, consider <m>\{x : |x-2| \lt 5\}</m>.
        When <m>x-2 \ge 0</m>, recall that <m>|x-2|=x-2</m>.
        On the other hand, when <m>x-2 \lt 0</m>, recall that <m>|x-2| = -(x-2)</m>.
        There are therefore two ways that the inequality in our set can be satisfied:
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}
          0 \le x-2 &amp; \lt 5\\
          2 \le x &amp; \lt 7
          \end{aligned}
        </me>
        or
        <me>
          \begin{aligned}
          0 \le -(x-2) &amp; \lt 5\\
          0 \le -x + 2 &amp; \lt 5\\
          -2 \le -x &amp; \lt 3 \\
          2 \ge x &amp; \gt -3.
          \end{aligned}
        </me>
        All together, this means that <m>\{x : |x-2| \lt 5\} = (-3,2] \cup [2,7) = (-3,2)</m>.
